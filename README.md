# Design of Experiments

## Investigating Noise Levels in Campus Study Locations

#### Objectives
Noise levels in different study locations affect student experiences. In relation to study locations on the University of Arizona campus, an experiment is conducted to address the following research questions:
1. Which study location is the most comfortable in terms of noise and distraction?
2. How does the expected noise of each location differ during the morning and afternoon?
3. Does the expected noise for each location change based on day of the week (beginning, middle, and end)?

With this, an experimental design with a full factorial design, with 3 factors, one with a = 3 levels (location), one with b = 3 levels (day of week), and one with c = 2 levels (time of day), repeated within each of d = 4 blocks (observer), each with n = 2 replicates is conducted. 

#### Tasks
1. Design a Full Factorial experiment
2. Fit an ANOVA model
3. Create interaction plots
4. Perform formal tests with Tukeyâ€™s test for additivity
5. Check model assumptions with model diagnostics
6. Compute Tukey-adjusted confidence intervals
7. Make recommendations based on statistical analysis
